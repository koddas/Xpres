## Notes to IntelliJ IDEA users

The default IntelliJ IDEA Java project layout uses a *src* directory to store the Java source files, which is not present in this repository. Create a *src* directory in the root folder and move the Java sources there. While moving the *xpres* and *xpres2* directories to the *src* directory, IntelliJ IDEA might add an additional package statement. Remove that additional statement. Also, remove the headers in the .g4 files to avoid name clashes.
